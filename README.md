# Skillify
This is a talent tracker tool that helps HR departments of companies find and confirm talent. Currently, skillify adresses candidates applying to programming/development roles. The tool works by interfacting with the Stack Overflow API to confirm a candidates skills. The plan for the future is to cover a broader range of candidates.

### How to run:
- Git clone
- Navigate to root folder
- Open index.html with the browser of your choice
- Find your candidate on Stack Overflow and copy thier unique id that you will find in the url of their stack overflow profile page.
- Generally the id will be part of the URL like so: https://stackoverflow.com/users/USER_ID_FOUND_HERE/t-j-crowder

Some example Id's you can test with to get started:
893
23354
104349
